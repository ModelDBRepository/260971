Scripts used for the multi-compartmental NEURON simulations in order to determine the Ca2+ currents through NMDA-receptor channels when the timing between pre- and post-synaptic
stimulation is varied. The minimum amount of data for drawing Fig. 6 is pre-saved in the .mat files. The mod mechanisms and hoc files are from the NMC portal: https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/

Scripts adapted by Tuomo Maki-Marttunen 2018-2020 from simulation scripts at https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/microcircuit#/metype/L23_PC_cADpyr/details (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)

Files and directories included:
 L23_PC_cADpyr229_*
  -Directories containing the morphology files of five L23PCs.
 biophysics.hoc
  -A hoc file containing the biophysical parameters of all five L23PCs.

 collectcurrs_manyinputs_varyNMDA_oneISI.py
  -A python file used for collecting data from simulations with different random numberr seeds.
