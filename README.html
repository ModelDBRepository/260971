This is a single-compartment model of cortical synapse and the intracellular signaling within as described in
M&auml;ki-Marttunen T, Iannella N, Edwards AG, Einevoll GT, Blackwell KT: A unified computational model for cortical post-synaptic plasticity.

Three folders are included in this ModelDB entry:
L23PC 
  A model from NMC portal: https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/downloads. Includes scripts used for calculation of the Ca2+ transients through
  NMDA receptors in the paired-stimulus experiment. Pre-calculated data included for running the scripts needed for reproduction of Figure 6.
  
NEURON
  Scripts used for the single-compartment simulations of the plasticity in the post-synaptic spine using NEURON RxD simulator. Contains
  also the scripts for drawing the Figures of the paper.

NeuroRD
  Scripts used for the single-compartment simulations of the plasticity in the post-synaptic spine using NeuroRD simulator.

Software:
 -The scripts assume the command "python" runs Python 2.7 with packages neuron (v7.5), numpy, scipy, and matplotlib installed. For Python 3,
  the print commands should be reformatted to have parentheses and the "<>" signs in model_nrn*.py and simsteadystate_flexible.py should be
  replaced by "!="
 -The NeuroRD simulations worked with Java version 1.8.0_131

To draw Fig. 1, run the following commands (if you get errors see NEURON/README.html for issues with NEURON RxD version):
<font color=green>
cd NEURON
sh runfig1.sh     
python drawfig1.py
cd ..
</font>

To draw Fig. 3, run the following commands (if you get errors see NeuroRD/README.html for issues with the java command):
<font color=green>
cd NeuroRD
sh runsteadystate.sh
sh runfig3_nrd.sh
cd ../NEURON
sh runfig3.sh
python drawfig3.py
cd ..
</font>

To draw Fig. 4 and 5 and Extended data Fig. 4.1, run the following commands:
<font color=green>
cd NeuroRD
#sh runsteadystate.sh #skip this if you ran it already for Fig. 3
sh runfig4_nrd.sh
cd NEURON
sh runfig4-5.sh
sh runfig4_1.sh
python drawfig4.py
python drawfig5.py
python drawfig4_1.py
cd ..
</font>

To draw Fig. 6, run the following commands:
<font color=green>
cd NEURON
sh runfig6.sh
python drawfig6.py
cd ..
</font>

To draw Fig. 9 panels A-C, run the following commands:
<font color=green>
cd NEURON
sh runfig9.sh
python drawfig9abc.py
cd ..
</font>
